The scheme, known as \"Project Braveheart,\" involved a sham sale of certain assets to accelerate recognition of income from a long-term agreement to develop and provide video-on-demand services; they sought to sell an interest in the future revenues associated with this agreement for purposes of immediate income recognition; Project Braveheart was a sham from its inception: the transaction had no economic substance and was created solely for the purpose of generating income.",

As alleged in the Complaint, Colwell, along with others at Enron, engaged in a wide ranging scheme to defraud by manipulating Enron's publicly reported earnings through a variety of devices designed to produce materially false and misleading financial results; this scheme included the misuse of reserve accounts, concealment of losses, inflation of asset values, and deliberate use of improper accounting treatment for transactions; alleged that Colwell and others used reserve accounts within ENA to mask over $1 billion in losses associated with Enron's retail energy business, Enron Energy Services; further alleged that when Enron needed earnings in third quarter 2001, Colwell and others released from ENA reserve accounts over $200 million of previously deferred trading profits.",

The SEC's complaint alleges that shortly before his departure from Enron, between May 18, 2001 and June 7, 2001, Pai sold 338,897 shares of Enron stock and exercised stock options that resulted in the sale of 572,818 shares to the open market yielding millions of dollars in proceeds. Before making these sales, Pai learned from EES successor management that it had identified certain financial and operational problems and substantial contract-related losses at EES. Pai knew or should have known that he could not sell Enron stock without first disclosing such material, nonpublic information. By selling Enron stock without disclosing this information, Pai breached his fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders.",

Pai, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron Xcelerator, alleging that Pai sold Enron stock in May and June 2001 on the basis of material, nonpublic information concerning Enron. The SEC's complaint alleges that shortly before his departure from Enron, between May 18, 2001 and June 7, 2001, Pai sold 338,897 shares of Enron stock and exercised stock options that resulted in the sale of 572,818 shares to the open market yielding millions of dollars in proceeds. Before making these sales, Pai learned from EES successor management that it had identified certain financial and operational problems and substantial contract-related losses at EES. Pai knew or should have known that he could not sell Enron stock without first disclosing such material, nonpublic information. By selling Enron stock without disclosing this information, Pai breached his fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders.",
